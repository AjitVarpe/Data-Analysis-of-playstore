# Data-Analysis-of-playstore
Study aims to predict the ratings
of Google Play Store apps. <br> I
have tried to perform Data
Analysis and prediction into the
Google Play store application
datasets that I have collected
from AlmaBetter Website. <br> 
Using Exploratory Data Analysis,We have
tried to discover the relationships
among various attributes present
in my datasets such as which
application is free or paid, about
the user reviews, rating of the
application,etc.
<br>
# Conclusion
After undergoing these
algorithms and process, we
concluded that our hypothesis is
true. Meaning we can predict the
app ratings <br>
We have made a Conclusion
below :
<br>
1. User mostly prefer free apps compare to paid apps. Playstore contain large numbers of free application.
2. Application that are for
everyone have rating form
4 to 5.
<br>
3. Family, Games , Social,
tools, etc. category having
highest numbers of
download.
<br>
4. Also, customer ratings
plays a huge role while
releasing the application.
<br>
5. Sentiment of application
does not affect much to the
final rating of the app due
to proportional behaviour.
<br>
6. Popular categories having
high positive sentiments.
<br>
7. Positive sentiments are
highest compare to neutral
and negative sentiments
as sentiment subjectivity is
not always proportional to
sentiment polarity.
